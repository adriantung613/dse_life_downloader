By directly running the file "main.py", it will automatically download all necessary file in "dsepp.ru". Better put "main.py" in an empty directory to avoid error.

Then you can access all the materials by going into the "static/pp" directory or 
open "DseLife.html" to access all files in your broser locally.

If there is any update in dse life, simply running main.py again would download the remaining files that are added to dse life.
